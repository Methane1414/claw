## TwoD FVM code  on unstructured quadrilateral grids

This can solve PDE of the form $u_t + v_1(x,y) u_x + v_2(x,y) u_y = 0,$ where $v= (v_1,v_2)$ is the advection velocity.

Numerical flux: Upwind numerical flux is implemented, you just need to changes the velocity() function to set the PDE

The face normals are computed by finding the vector joining the face nodes and writing vector perpendicular to this.

To ensure that the normal velocity vector is facing outward to the leftcell a check is used.

Grid files are written in grid.h, it creates an object of Nodes, Faces and Cells. Nodes and Cells are assigned id

ranging from 0 to size of Nodes and Cells respectively. For each Face, we can access the Left and Right cells. 

If a face is a part of the boundary, then right cell is always marked as -1 as there is no right cell. 

##Things to do

1. Implementation of boundary condition: Periodic, Dirichlet, Inflow, Outflow etc.
2. Fixing CFL and use of various numfluxes.
3. Need to assign the ID s for Cells and update the vtk file.
4. Initialize the solution by finding the average through quadrature
